The name of this application is GoDJ. 

GoDJ is an application that allows DJ's to create a profile, add events, add links to their music, and more. 
The purpose of GoDJ is for DJ's to be able to market themselves to those looking for their services. 
Currently, many DJ's have a hard time to entering the industry. If you don't already have a heavy following, it's hard
to gain traction and it's rare that you are booked unless you sell yourself short. GODJ will create an opportunity for consumers to 
search for a DJ, listen to their mixes, and read reviews for that DJ.

Current Functionality:
	Create a profile for a user. Upload profile photo and description of the user. 
	Upload events along with date, start-time, and description.
	Query a list of users who use the app. 
	Create a review for a user and display it on that user's profile. 

GoDJ is built using Appcelerator Titanium Studio
